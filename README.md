JS-Widgets is series of small projects that work on implementing popular design elements in real projects that confuse me when I encounter the first time

# Context menu - Definition

A context menu is a pop-up menu that provide actions that the software developers anticipate the user might want to take (credit: techtarget)

# Why I Care

I was working on [Planner App](https://github.com/tdnguyen04/Planner-App) that I realize the need to create a custom context menu to choose "Delete" for a task in a list. Although I am not a fan of implementing this in real project as it inhibits other typical actions on browser such as copy, paste, search, etc., there are popular use cases

# Popular Use Cases

I believe this still comes in handy for applications that have special use cases.

- Google implemented custom context menu for its text area in Google Docs and cells in Google Sheets. It is understandable as these applications play a role of text editors and typical actions are irrelevant.
- Gmail, Outlook Mails, and most other mail services build their own context menu when users right-click on any emails in the list
